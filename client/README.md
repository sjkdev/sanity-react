# React Sanity Babel Webpack Starter

> Starter with nav and routing set up 

> add a client.js file with your sanity deets and make sure it is referenced in gitignore

> uses -> webpack, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap, sass, babel, helmet, react-snap, see packgae.json for deps

> Use when Nextjs, Gatsby or CRA seem too opinionated or bloated, feel free to swap out react-bootstrap for tailwind or whatever you like

> Added [react-snap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snap) 

> Added [react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) for meta tags and assigned to each page

> Added axios and fetch examples to teach beginners how to get http request using function components and hooks instead of older styled class based components with lifecycle methods and to illustrate difference between axios and fetch
